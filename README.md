# structARal_NSF 
#This project is supported by the National Science Foundation, and the code is available (open-source) for any educational and academic purposes.

#Project info: 

	#Developed by Kexin Wang, kexinw@iastate.edu
	#Unity Version: 2020.3.3
	#Credit: Mathmaticale calculation formula in this project is credited to David Wehr from previous version of the app
	#Source code: https://github.com/kate-Kexin-Wang/structARal_NSF.git
	#Packages used in the application: Vuforia Engine AR, Native Gallery for Android & iOS

#Project Content:

	#Editor - Vuforia background autogenerated files  
	#Image - All image assets used in the project
	#Material - All materials used in the project 
	#Plugins - Native Gallery for Android & iOS plugin for taking screenshots 
	#Resources - Models, prefabs, and Vuforia model target data 
	#Scenes - MainMenue, Skywalk, Campanile, CattHall, TownHall 

#Each scene uses a similar scene structure: 
	1. Main Camera to see the static image 
	2. AR Camera for image target and model target 
	3. Directional Light in the scene 
	4. Canvas and EventSystem for UI elements 
	5. StaticImage & scene_N for pre-loaded Image and corresponding models, force arrows, etc.
	6. ImageTarget & scene_I for indoor model AR image target and corresponding models, force arrows, etc. 
	7. ModelTarget for outdoor model target and corresponding models, force arrows, etc. 

#Script: 
	-ARmanager1.cs: AR functionality

	Campanile:
		-CamInterfaceManager.cs: Interface functionality in Campanile scene 
		-ForceUpdte.cs: Force calculation when inputting wind load or seismic load 
		-SeismicLoad.cs & WindLoad.cs: Control input of these values from both slider and touch screen 
	Cattrall: 
		-Catt_Interface.cs: Interface functionality in CattHall scene
		-PointForce.cs: Force calculation when inputting wind load or Snowfall 
		-CattLiveLoad & CattWindLaod.cs: Control input of these values from both slider and touch screen 
	Skywalk:

		-Live load.cs: Control input of live load from both slider and touch screen
		-ReactionForce.cs: Calculation of Reaction Force when inputting live load 
		-Skywalk_Interface.cs: Interface functionality in Campanile Scene
	TownHall:
		-FixJoinUI.cs: Fix join diagram
		-Town_ReactionForce.cs: Calculation of reaction force when inputting live load and wind force
		-TownDeflection.cs: Deformation bezier curve functionality
		-TownHall_Interface.cs: Interface functionality in TownHall Scene
		-TownLiveLoad.cs & TownWindForce.cs: Control input of live load and wind force from both slider and touch screen 


#Additional Notes: 
#The project is built with each module separately with a similar scene structure:
	1. UI interface
	2. Bezier curve functionality for deformation
	3. Load input from both slider and touch screen
	4. The calculation for reaction force or momentum 
#To expand the work to other buildings will need:
	1. Vuforia model target from desired buildings; detailed information can be found at: https://library.vuforia.com/objects/model-targets
	2. Create Vuforia image target from desired images; detailed information can be found at: https://library.vuforia.com/objects/image-targets
	3. Mathematical function to calculate reaction force or momentum from input values
